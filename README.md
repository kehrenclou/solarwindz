# Solar and Wind Power - a global overview

This is a project that was part of Practicum's "Code Bridge" Challenge which pairs one Data Science Student with a Software Engineering student. The Code Bridge consists of three parts - a landing page, dataset analysis and visualisation, and a presentation that will be streamed on YouTube.

Data sets were chosen from https://github.com/dataPracticum/code_bridge.
The sets used were
-the Global-Solar-Power-Tracker-May-2022
-the Global-Wind-Power-Tracker-May-2022
