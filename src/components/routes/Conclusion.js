      <p className="view__content_paragraph">
        Throughout our analysis of the Wind and Solar datasets, we saw various
        stories that the data told.
      </p>
      <p className="view__content_paragraph">
        It shows that China and the United States are obvious solar and wind
        enthusiasts, both producing their alternative energy sources at a high
        level. China however pulls away from the United States and other
        countries as they have dominated implementation.
      </p>
      <p className="view__content_paragraph">
        It also displayed that even though the United States was always the
        first to implement, China was not too far behind and always outpaced
        their western counterpart.
      </p>
      <p className="view__content_paragraph">
        China was a popular topic in these datasets but Asia as a region wins.
        Its combined solar and energy production was double of the next region,
        North America.
      </p>
      <p className="view__content_paragraph">
        Even though our focus was only active solar and wind plants I believe
        the datasets could be dove in multiple different ways. You could focus
        on construction status and see which countries are positioned to
        dominate in the future. You could also look at statuses related to
        retired and see what countries were on the up and up but fell apart.
      </p>
